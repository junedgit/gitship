### **WIP - see you soon :)**

# GitShip

## **The "Twitch for Coders"**

## GitShip brings the best parts of Good Old Git with a Modern EcoSystem:

- **Watch code evolve** like you're pair programming remotely
- **Fork any live session** to experiment risk-free
- **Everything stays versioned** - no more "where did that change come from?"

Built for developers who care about:

‚ö°Ô∏è **Real-time sync** that would actually works  
üß† **Minimalist design** that stays out of your way  
üîß **Proper engineering** under the hood

---

## Why This Exists

Most dev tools force you to choose between:

- Git's safety net
- Live collaboration's speed

GitShip says: **why not both?**

---

## Tech Stack Deep Cut

We use:

- **TypeScript** OfCourse
- **PartyKit** - WebSockets without the headache
- **Neon** - Serverless Postgres that doesn't bankrupt you
- **Turborepo** - Because waiting for builds is so 2010
- **package.json pls**
